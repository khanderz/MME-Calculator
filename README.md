# MME-Calculator
Morphine Milligram Equivalent (MME) Calculator
## Description:
MME is a numerical standard for clinicians to gauge opioid addiction risk. It is the amount of morphine in milligrams equivalent to the strength of the opioid dose prescribed. Calculating total daily MME can help guide clinicians in pain management and aid in mitigating opioid addiction and accidental overdose. The calculator will calculate the total daily MME for the given medication list. 

There is no completely safe opioid dose, and this calculator does not substitute for clinical judgment. Use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, and prescribe the lowest effective dose.
